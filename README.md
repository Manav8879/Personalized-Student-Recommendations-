# Quiz Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project is designed to load, analyze, and generate insights from quiz data. The data is divided into two categories: **current quiz data** and **historical quiz data**. The main objective is to identify weak areas for users based on their quiz performance and suggest topics for improvement. The project leverages Python and various libraries such as `pandas` and `requests` for data processing and analysis.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`: For handling and manipulating data.
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to retrieve the quiz data.
